## Thanks to:

This project use the work of two awesome projects. [evanoberholster/timezoneLookup](https://github.com/evanoberholster/timezoneLookup) is go library that find the timezone for a coordinate. This project use the shapefile of this project [evansiroky/timezone-boundary-builder](https://github.com/evansiroky/timezone-boundary-builder). 

## How to use:

This project based on the new go modules. So you only need `go >= 1.11`. Change in project folder and call `go build` to build the binaries or `go run main.go` to start the application directly.

## Docker:

Or you use docker. Then you can change in the project folder and call `docker build -t tz-service .` and after the build `docker run -p 8080:8080 tz-service`.
